# Shy
<p><i><b>Sh</b>ell + P<b>y</b>thon = Shy</i></p>

Shy is a shell written in Python which tries to be extensible while
trying to keep things simple.

## Current status
At this point in time, Shy will most definitely not replace your
existing shell. However, you can help me with extending Shy's features
and capabilities by contributing.

## How to use it
Install it:
```sh
pip install .
```
and run it:
```sh
shy
```

Or if you want to run it locally:
```sh
python ./bin/shy
```
